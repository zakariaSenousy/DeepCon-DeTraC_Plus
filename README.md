DeepCon: Unleashing the Power of Divide and Conquer Deep Learning for Colorectal Cancer Classification

## Dataset Overview
In this work, we used the dataset **CRC-VAL-HE-7K** from the Institute of Pathology (University Medical Center Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany). The dataset contains 5,000 images, equally distributed in 8 classes of 625 images each. The classes include TUMOR, STROMA, COMPLEX, LYMPHO, DEBRIS, MUCOSA, ADIPOSE, and EMPTY/BACKGROUND. All images are 224Ã—224 pixels at 0.5 microns per pixel with TIF format.
